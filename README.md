# README

This is a sample e-commerce application I created with Ruby on Rails.  It was just an exercise for me
to get used to the framework.  It was written to retrieve product information from Kroger foods, although
if you would like to run this, you will need your own api keys.  It's easy enough to sign up for one through 
https://developer.kroger.com

Enjoy.
